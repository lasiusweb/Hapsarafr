## Brand Voice and Personality
The brand's voice and personality will consistently project a professional and trustworthy image. We aim for users to perceive us as reliable, secure, and an industry expert. The tone will be serious and respectful, reflecting our commitment to accuracy and user confidence.

## Visual Identity and Design Language
